# Skeet Server Connection Script
This Lua script provides a simple interface to connect to game servers. The script maintains a list of game servers stored in a text file, allowing users to easily manage and connect to their preferred servers.

**Features**
- Add servers to a list by specifying the server's IP and port, and a unique name.
- Directly connect to any server on the list by clicking a button.

**Usage**
- Download the Lua [here](https://github.com/GiftStein1/gamesense-server-saver/blob/main/server-list.lua).

- Put in your CSGO Folder

- Load the script in gamesense.

- Use the input fields in Lua Tab "B" to add servers to your list. Enter the server's IP and port in the "IP:Port" field, and a unique name for the server in the "Name" field.

- Click the "Confirm" button to add the server to the list. The server will appear as a new button with the name you provided.

- Click a server button to connect to that server.
